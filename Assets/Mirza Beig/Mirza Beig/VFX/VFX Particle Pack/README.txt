- ULTIMATE VFX PARTICLE PACK v1.5.0:

A collection of high quality spritesheets, textures, and presets using the Shuriken particle system.
Once decompressed into your project, simply drag any prefab from the _prefab folder into your own scene.

You can start off by editing an existing prefab, or from scratch using the assets provided (textures, shaders, etc).

The sizes of the single-frame sprite textures vary depending on how I assumed they would be used 
or the source images used to make them (for some of the textures, I used my own stock photos).

In instantiated particle mode, right-click to spawn a one-shot prefab that will 
destroy itself when it's finished simulating all particles across all systems.

BONUS ASSETS:
- Particle Twister
- Advanced Particle Scaler (free with Ultimate VFX Particle Pack!)

> Go to Window -> Mirza Beig to use these editor utilities.

Hidden controls:
- Left-click in instantiated particle mode will constantly spawn the selected prefab.
- Holding "R" in instantiated particle mode will cycle randomly through all the prefabs.
- Holding "R" + "T" in instantiated particle mode will constantly spawn random particles.
